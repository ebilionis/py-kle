Karhunen-Loeve Expansions for Gaussian Random Fields in Python
==============================================================

This package has the sole purpose of constructing Karhunen-Loeve Expansions (KLE)
of Gaussian Random Fields given their covariance function. At the moment we only
do what is known as Discrete (KLE).
